# ColdCase
The goal of the interactive smartphone application Cold Case AR is to combine community involvement, augmented reality (AR), maps integration, and true crime storytelling.  Through an immersive and instructive experience, the app enables users to inspect evidence, investigate both real and hypothetical cold cases, and participate properly in debates.
